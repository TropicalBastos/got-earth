        "description": "Winterfell is the seat of the ruler of the North and the ancestral home of House Stark. It is a very large castle located at the center of the North, from where the head of House Stark rules over his or her people. A small Godswood is enclosed within the walls. It is the regional capital of the North under Jon Snow. The castle is located alongside the Kingsroad as it makes its way from the Wall to the capital of the Seven Kingdoms, King's Landing, more than a thousand miles to the south.\n\n It is situated atop hot springs which keep the castle warm even in the worst winters. Winding tombs below the castle contain the remains of Stark kings and lords and record the history of the ancient family. According to maester Luwin, there are hidden passageways built in the castle so its Lords could escape. The castle has stood for millennia.\n\n The castle was put to the torch by Ramsay Snow after Theon Greyjoy was betrayed by his own crew. This burned out the wood portions of the castle, though the core stone structures remained fundamentally intact, as did the enclosed godswood. After the surrender of Moat Cailin, the Bolton army relocated to the ruined castle in order to restore it as the seat of the rulers of the North.\n\n Winterfell remained in Bolton hands for a time until their defeat at the Battle of the Bastards, at which point the castle was returned to House Stark's ownership. It is currently jointly the seat of Jon Snow – the Warden of the North – and Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell.",
