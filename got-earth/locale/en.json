        "description": "Winterfell is the seat of the ruler of the North and the ancestral home of House Stark. It is a very large castle located at the center of the North, from where the head of House Stark rules over his or her people. A small Godswood is enclosed within the walls. It is the regional capital of the North under Jon Snow. The castle is located alongside the Kingsroad as it makes its way from the Wall to the capital of the Seven Kingdoms, King's Landing, more than a thousand miles to the south.\n\n It is situated atop hot springs which keep the castle warm even in the worst winters. Winding tombs below the castle contain the remains of Stark kings and lords and record the history of the ancient family. According to maester Luwin, there are hidden passageways built in the castle so its Lords could escape. The castle has stood for millennia.\n\n The castle was put to the torch by Ramsay Snow after Theon Greyjoy was betrayed by his own crew. This burned out the wood portions of the castle, though the core stone structures remained fundamentally intact, as did the enclosed godswood. After the surrender of Moat Cailin, the Bolton army relocated to the ruined castle in order to restore it as the seat of the rulers of the North.\n\n Winterfell remained in Bolton hands for a time until their defeat at the Battle of the Bastards, at which point the castle was returned to House Stark's ownership. It is currently jointly the seat of Jon Snow – the Warden of the North – and Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell.",

        "description": "King's Landing is the capital, and largest city, of the Seven Kingdoms. Located on the east coast of Westeros in the Crownlands, just north of where the Blackwater Rush flows into Blackwater Bay and overlooking Blackwater Bay, King's Landing is the site of the Iron Throne and the Red Keep, the seat of the King of the Andals and the First Men. It enjoys a warm climate and life there is luxurious for those that can afford it, although it is not without its slums such as Flea Bottom. The city is overpopulated and dangerous at the best of times, despite being policed by the City Watch.\n\nKing's Landing was founded by King Aegon I Targaryen, King of the Andals and the First Men. He established a small wooden fort atop the hill, named the Aegonfort in his honor, where his ships first landed from Dragonstone, and used this as a base for his campaign to conquer the continent. Having achieved his goal, he established the new capital on the site of his original fort. The city expanded rapidly under his descendants. By the time of Robert's Rebellion, the city had a population of approximately half a million people.\n\nKing's Landing has suffered occasional attacks during its existence, most notably during the civil war known as Robert's Rebellion, when Lord Tywin Lannister betrayed King Aerys II Targaryen and ordered his army to brutally sack the city before turning it over to Robert Baratheon as a sign of fealty.\n\nDuring the War of the Five Kings, the problems in King's Landing have multiplied. The worst of these are the food shortages exacerbated by an influx of refugees into the city seeking the protection of the city walls from the war, this even led to a riot at one point early into the war during which the High Septon, and Aron Santagar perished, along with many other citizens.\n\nDespite its opulence and status as the capital, King's Landing is often referred to in a derisive manner by outsiders. A recurring theme is the stench of human waste; the crowded population and sea breeze means such smells are particularly pungent.",

Castle Black is located between the unmanned castles of Queensgate and Oakenshield.\n\nCastle Black has a sept, but no Godswood. Those who are followers of the Old Gods of the Forest must travel a mile north of the Wall and into the Haunted Forest to take their vows before a heart tree.\n\nAfter learning of the breaching of the Wall, Jon Snow orders the remaining castles on the Wall be abandoned and for their garrisons to come to Winterfell.",

The Eyrie straddles the top of a peak in the Mountains of the Moon several thousand feet above the valley floor below. It is approached by a narrow causeway and road. Those who would approach the Eyrie must pass through three way-castles guarding the ascent - and then, must proceed in single file, making them very vulnerable to archers. For these reasons, the Eyrie is considered impregnable to any attack that does not involve dragons, and its defenses have never been overcome. It is currently the seat of Robin Arryn – the Warden of the East.\n\nThe High Hall of the Eyrie is the main audience chamber, where the Lord of the Vale greets visitors from a throne made of weirwood. A notable feature of the chamber is the moon door, a hatch built into the floor through which people can fall to the floor of the Vale far below. Being thrown through the moon door is the preferred method of execution at the Eyrie.\n\nPrisoners at the Eyrie are incarcerated in the sky cells, cells which are open on one side to the air. There is a very slight slope in the cells, and prisoners must be careful not to roll out of the cell in their sleep and plummet to their deaths.",

It is a major barrier to travelers and merchants traveling from the North to the western Riverlands. It lies directly on the main route from Winterfell to Riverrun. Moving from one castle to the other while avoiding the Twins requires a lengthy detour hundreds of miles to the south or hazardously traversing the bogs and swamps of the Neck to the north. Travelers heading south who cannot pass southwest over the Twins must pass southeast along the Kingsroad.\n\nThe Freys' rise began six hundred years before the events of the series with the building of a stone bridge over the Green Fork. It took three generations to build the Twins, but afterwards they quickly grew wealthy by charging passing travelers for the use of the Crossing. The bridge is a massive arch of smooth grey stone, wide enough for two wagons to pass abreast.",

Unlike the richly-decorated and extravagant Red Keep in King's Landing, Dragonstone is sparsely decorated and has a rough, austere appearance; its function is as a military base, not as a palace.\n\nThe castle itself is very strong, due to its advanced Valyrian design, which combined with its isolated location make it an ideal redoubt and refuge - for both the Targaryens and Stannis Baratheon. Because of these features and its geographic position, it is extremely difficult to breach and can be held by a relatively small garrison against a vastly larger force.",
